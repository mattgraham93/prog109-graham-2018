    <p class="textContent">I recently had a realization on what I want to do to help leave a positive impact on this world
    <br/>
    As someone who suffers from anxiety and depression and feels a deep empathy for humanity, it has become my goal to help leave a positive impact on this world through teaching the importance of mental health backed with data.
    <br/>
    My goal is to start by gathering data and modelling what would change locally, nationally, and hopefully internationally. I believe that bringing awareness to everyone's mental health can have a positive economic and cultural impact.
    To start, this theme will be derived from colors that are particularly pleasing to those who suffer from anxiety and depression. These colors are: turquoise, violet, and green. These colors will be on a back background and will be common throughout.</p>
